				Private American Universities Use of “Neutral” Language Makes Some Students Feel Unsafe
			</h1>
			<h3>Private universities in the United States have been critiqued for choosing language that does not "pick a side," but data suggests the language is more skewed.</h3>

			<p class="intro">With just over a month since the initial attack on Israel, American universities have taken a sensitive approach to the language they use to describe the situation. This has created some discontent among the student bodies of several universities.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				On-campus protests have run rampant, and on Columbia University’s campus, students and professors alike have begun to critique university officials.

            <br>
            <p>
                The most elite schools and the six biggest private schools have shared the news with their students from the perspective of the Israelis, discussing hatred and isolation from their point of view over other groups. Common throughout all statements, there was zero mention of Islamophobia and the term “Muslim,” according to data scraped by reporters. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Students from these campuses have noticed this, particularly those from the marginalized groups these statements affect. Among them, is Sarah Selma, a Human Rights student who identifies as Muslim.

            <br>
            <p>
                “We feel like terrorists on campus due to these ‘nuanced’ neutral statements, in fact, it’s more damaging,” said Selma, a Columbia University student.
